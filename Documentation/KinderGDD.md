# Kinder Game Development Document
## Game Concept
Kinder is a 4 person turn based strategy game reminiscent of titles such as Octopath Traveler and Persona. It has a large focus on story and the development of characters. Kinder will have independant game progression between two campaigns set in a High Fantasy world in the future.
### Genre
Kinder belongs to the 4-man Turn Based Strategy Genre similar to that of a typical JRP. 
### Target Audience
The target Audience is a niche of fans that enjoy such games as Octopath Traveler, Persona, Fire Emblem and others.
### Project Scope
IDK how to quantify this at this moment
## Gameplay Mechanics/ Progression
### Objectives
The player's objective will be to advance the story and gain power in terms of exp and gear. A hope-to-have will be the implementation of a character interaction system. This way the characters don't seem bland or devoid of life with characters growing in relation to each other. Persona and Fire Emblem as reference as to how this can make a both engaging and fun objective. Implementation pending.
### General Structure
The game will have an overworld where the characters can traverse different locations. These locations may have events of different characters that the party is directed to. Not all are mandatory. There are two parties that the player may switch between. Both parties will have moments in which their story is paused before needing progress on the other. This is done in order to keep a more consistent pace between both parties and to keep gameplay fresh. This might change however to allow more freedom up until a point where a story beat would absolutely need the two to be joined. The player would always be able to switch between the two but certain story beats would be marked off.

During certain sections there will either be a random encounter chance or an enemy object within these areas that chases the player. The benefits for both are as follows: The player in the random chance would have a more quantifiable way to pace encounters and expected levels. The enemy being an dodgeable encounter would provide some amount of interaction in the way that these encounters play out. This puts the onus on the player to choose when to farm/encounter meaning that the likelihood that a player would be at a lower level than intended be higher. 

Combat will be covered in another section: SEE COMBAT
### Combat
Combat has a multitude of different avenues that will be outlined below:

Time Based: Time would move so that when each player's bar fills up they then get to act. Battle then pauses when the player selects an action. AA would be made immediately and Skills would have their own completion bar that would fill before the action follows through. During this time both player and enemies skills may be interrupted. 

Understand how the mana and skill points will work in relation to skills and gameplay. 

Pure Turn Based: To be cont.
